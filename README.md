# codon
Nucleoic acid translation tool for Google Chrome.

//////////////////////////////////////

Codon is a Chrome Extension that allows users to quickly convert a sequence of nucleotides into their corresponding amino acids.

For those in need of a quick genetics refresher, please see the following link for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

//////////////////////////////////////

0) Save all relevant Chrome Extension files to a folder on yor desktop.

USER INSTRUCTIONS

//////////////////////////////////////

The extension is now loaded and ready for use. To use the extension, copy a sequence of nucleotides (example: ATGACCATCTTTCCTGGG) and paste it into the textbox with the "Nucleotide Sequence" header. When ready to translate the sequence, click the 'Translate' button, and the translated nucleotide sequence will appear as the corresponding amino acids in the textbox below the 'Translate' button, appropriately labeled "Amino Acid Sequence". 

The program supports strings of both capitalized and lowercase letters when inputting the nucleotides. Note that submitting a string containing any other characters or any numbers will throw an error. Input strings with sizes that are not multiples of 3 will also throw an error 3 nucleotides are necessary to code for 1 amino acid.
